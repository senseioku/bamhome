✓ CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED: bamPriceInUSD constant set to wrong value (100 instead of 1e11)
✓ Root cause identified: bamPriceInUSD = 100 makes contract calculate 10 quadrillion BAM per USDT
✓ User clarified: 0.0000001 USDT = 1 BAM, so 1 USDT = 10,000,000 BAM tokens
✓ Fixed bamPriceInUSD: Changed from 100 to 1e11 to give correct 10M BAM per USDT
